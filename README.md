# Laboratory Work 6

# Discription

This project includes the following tasks:
1.	Create a Person class that contains: 
a) fields fullName, age. 
b) the move() and talk() methods, which simply display the message "So-and-so Person is talking" on the console. 
c) Add two constructors - Person() and Person(fullName, age).
Create two objects of this class. One object is initialized with the Person() constructor, the other with Person(fullName, age).

2.	The Phone class.
а) Create a Phone class that contains the number, model, and weight fields.
б) Create three instances of this class.
c) Print the values of their variables to the console.
г) Add methods to the Phone class: receiveCall, has one parameter - the name of the caller. Displays the message "Calling {name}" on the console. getNumber - returns the phone number. Call these methods for each of the objects.
д) Add a constructor to the Phone class that takes three parameters to initialize the class fields - number, model and weight.
е) Add a constructor that takes two parameters to initialize the class fields - number, model.
ж) Add a constructor without parameters.
з) Add an overloaded receiveCall method that takes two parameters - the name of the caller and the phone number. Call this method.
к) Create a sendMessage method with variable length arguments. This method takes as input the phone numbers to which the message will be sent. The method displays the phone numbers of these phones on the console.
3.	Implement the hierarchy.
4.	Create an abstract class Car with the fields model, color and maximum speed. The class also contains methods : "regular" gas(), which simply displays some text on the screen (n.d., "Gas!") and an abstract method for braking void brake(). Implement the derived classes Sedan and Truck. Create objects of the Sedan and Truck classes. Execute methods on behalf of the created objects.
5.	Create a definition of the bank account class. Data elements: name, account number, balance. Elements-functions: put the amount to the account, withdraw the amount from the account, display the data.
6.	Based on the class specified in task 5, according to the option, create an heir class that extends the capabilities of the parent class. Add two fields to the newly created class (which ones? - think of your own), and also override the function of displaying class data on the screen.
